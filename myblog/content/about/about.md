I'm a final-year graduate at Cornell University, graduating May 2025 with a Bachelors and Masters in electrical and computer engineering. I am a versatile engineer interested in computer architecture and hardware software interfaces. I am currently working on integrating Microservices with Gem5, mentored by Mohammad Alian.

I most recently interned at AWS, where I worked on an up-and-coming/[redacted] team to automate internal ticket processing and derive retrieval-augmented generated (RAG) based solutions in the name of decreasing stressful oncall hours.

I am currently looking for a full-time job related to software engineering, embedded systems, or hardware verification starting after Summer 2025.

I hope to eventually continue my studies with a doctorate degree after several years of industry work. Please reach out if you are interested in any of my work.
